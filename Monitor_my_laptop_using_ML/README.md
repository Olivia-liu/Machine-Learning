# Personal project
This folder includes programs to monitor computer status using machine learning

# cpu_percent_static.py (python 3.6)
This program will monitor the CPU %utilization every 2 seconds for a total of 2 minutes and save the data in cpu_percent_data.txt in current directory. Then plot a graph which reflects the data.  

# cpu_percent_dynamic.py (python 3.6)
This program will plot a dynamic graph which reflects the data from cpu_percent_data.txt. This doesn't work as I expected, but it works in an interesting way.
