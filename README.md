# HW1 | week2 | linear regression with single variable (graded) and multiple variables (optional)
The vectorization video of the Matlab tutorial is very helpful for implementing gradient descent. 

Run with Matlab:

1. In matlab, change directory to the ex1 directory
2. Type ex1 at the prompt, hit enter and you will see a 5 by 5 identity matrix
3. Hit enter again and you will see a scatter plot figure 1
4. Hit enter again and you will see tests results for cost function
5. Then hit enter to run the gradient descent
6. Lastly, hit enter and you will see updated figure1, figure2 and figure 3.
